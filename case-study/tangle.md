# Tangle

![](/images/projects/tangle/header.png)

> **Role:** Programmer, Designer, Dev Ops

## Summary

Tangle's original implementation goal was to create a simple authentication system allowing a single user account to log into different Unity applications, similar to Battle.net's authentication system. It soon grew into a complex system that supported schema-less data stores, server management, file uploads, payment processing, and more.

## Objectives

-   Allow users to log into Tangle and join a server where other members are also using Tangle.
-   Allow users to create post-its, image uploads, links, etc and have that data be visible to other users as well a persist.
-   Allow users to manage servers and their memberships.
-   Allow users to invite users to servers and those users to accept or decline invites.
-   Allow users to manage subscription payments via third party payment processing.
-   Ensure users information is secure and that they only have access to the information they allowed to access and modify.
-   Ensure users connections to the audio/video servers are secure using authentication webhooks.
